# Overview
I've developed a YouTube clone using React. The application replicates the core functionalities of YouTube, allowing users to search for videos, view video details, and play videos directly within the app. The interface includes a search bar, video thumbnails, and a video player, all designed to mimic YouTube's familiar layout. By using React, the app ensures smooth rendering and efficient state management, providing users with a seamless and responsive experience similar to the original YouTube platform.

# Features
 • Search Functionality: Users can search for videos by entering keywords.

 • Video Details: Detailed information about each video, including likes, views, channel name.

 • Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works well on desktop and mobile devices.

# Technologies Used
 • ReactJS: Frontend development framework for    building user interfaces.

 • Open RapidAPI: API for fetching data.

 • CSS: Styling the user interface.

 • React Router: Client-side routing for navigation within the application.
